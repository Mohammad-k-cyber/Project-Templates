## üìà Progress Summary

We have completed the basic database structure implementation with all primary tables and their relationships. We have also implemented the password encryption system and basic JWT authentication system. We are currently working on improving query performance and setting up the backup system.

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Completed Components

- **Database Structure**: Created all primary tables (users, files, extracted texts, conversations)
- **Authentication System**: Implemented password encryption using bcrypt and created JWT system
- **Indexes**: Created basic indexes to improve the performance of common queries
- **User API Interface**: Created API endpoints for user management

### Technical Highlights

```sql
-- Example of implemented primary tables
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  last_login TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user'
);

CREATE TABLE files (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  file_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'uploaded'
);

-- Indexes to improve performance
CREATE INDEX idx_files_user ON files(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_files_status ON files(status);
```

```javascript
// Example of authentication function
function generateJWTToken(user) {
  const payload = {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    role: user.role
  };
  
  return jwt.sign(payload, JWT_SECRET, {
    expiresIn: '24h'
  });
}
```

### Architecture/Design Decisions

- **PostgreSQL Selection**: We decided to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite even for development to ensure development environment matches production
- **Separation of Conversation Tables**: We separated conversations from messages in different tables to facilitate future search and filtering
- **Authentication Approach**: We chose JWT instead of server sessions to facilitate horizontal scaling and improve API performance

### Integration Points

| System/Component | Integration Type | Status | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|--------|-------|
| File Upload System (MVP-1.1.2) | REST API Interface | In Progress | API interface documented, business logic implementation in progress |
| Content Extraction System (MVP-1.1.3) | REST API Interface | Planned | API design agreement reached with Content Extraction team |

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### Test Coverage
- Unit Tests: 75%
- Integration Tests: 40%

### Quality Metrics
- **Query Response Time**: 150ms (Target: <200ms)
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 99.8%
- **Error Coverage**: 85% of potential errors handled

### Known Issues
- **Slow Complex Queries**: Some queries involving multiple tables are slow (>300ms) - working on improving indexes
- **Memory Leak in Connection Pool**: Observed increased memory consumption over time - investigation in progress

## üöß Blockers & Challenges

### Current Blockers
- **Performance Testing**: We need larger test data to better evaluate database performance
- **Load Simulation**: We lack adequate load simulation tools to test 100 concurrent users

### Technical Challenges
- **Arabic Text Support**: We faced issues with sorting and ordering Arabic text - Solution: Configured server locale settings to support Arabic language
- **Connection Pooling**: There were issues managing the connection pool under load - Solution: We implemented a mechanism to dynamically size the pool

## üìù Changes & Updates

### Specification Changes
- Added `metadata` field of type JSONB to the files table for storing flexible metadata
- Modified `quality_score` field in the extracted texts table from FLOAT to JSON to support multiple quality metrics

### Scope Adjustments
- Added automatic backup setup functionality for critical data within the task scope
- Postponed implementation of database performance monitoring system to a later phase

## üìÖ Next Steps

### Upcoming Work
- Complete API interface for storing file information - Responsible: Aws, Date: 2025-09-19
- Implement backup system - Responsible: Sundus, Date: 2025-09-21
- Conduct final performance tests - Responsible: Osama, Date: 2025-09-23

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance Risks**: The database may not meet performance requirements under increased load - Mitigation: Early load testing and continuous query optimization
- **Security Risks**: There may be security vulnerabilities in the authentication system - Mitigation: Security review with specialized team

## üì¶ Deliverables

### Completed Deliverables
- Database Schema: [Link to document](https://github.com/org/project/docs/database_schema.md)
- User Management API Documentation: [Link to document](https://github.com/org/project/docs/user_api.md)
- SQL Scripts for Table Creation: [Link to document](https://github.com/org/project/db/init_scripts)

### Pending Deliverables
- File Storage API Documentation: 2025-09-19
- Backup and Recovery Plan: 2025-09-21
- Database Performance Report: 2025-09-23

## üîÑ Resource Utilization

- **Planned Effort:** 12 person-days
- **Actual Effort to Date:** 9 person-days
- **Estimated Remaining Effort:** 4 person-days
- **Expected Variance:** +8%
- **Explanation:** Arabic text processing and performance improvements required additional effort

## üì£ Communication & Coordination

### Team Updates
- Held database structure review meeting with the system architect
- Updated design documentation based on feedback

### Dependencies on Other Teams
- **File Upload System Team**: We need confirmation of file metadata requirements by 2025-09-19
- **Content Extraction Team**: We need review of extracted texts table design by 2025-09-20

### Support for Other Teams
- **File Upload System Team**: We will provide support for file storage API integration starting from 2025-09-20
- **Content Extraction Team**: We will provide data models and API documentation by 2025-09-21

## üí¨ Notes & Recommendations

- We recommend adding full-text search support in the database in the next phase
- We suggest conducting regular performance reviews monthly to ensure the database operates efficiently as data grows
